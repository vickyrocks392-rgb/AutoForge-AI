# AutoForge AI Project Dashboard

## Project Vision

AutoForge AI is an autonomous software engineering platform that transforms a user request into a completed, production-grade software project through specialised AI agents. It orchestrates the full SDLC — planning, research, architecture, implementation, testing, deployment, and documentation — with fault-tolerant, long-running execution and human-in-the-loop oversight.

## Current Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Completed Phases** | 3 of 21 |
| **Current Phase** | 3 — Core Platform Foundation |
| **Estimated Overall Completion** | ~14% |
| **Architecture Documents** | 22 |
| **Domain Models** | 14 (Project, Task, Artifact, Checkpoint, ExecutionSession, Employee, Review, Event, ModelProfile, MemoryEntry, KnowledgeNode, KnowledgeEdge, QualityGate, ResourceRequirements) |
| **Shared Enums** | 12 (TaskStatus, TaskPriority, ReviewStatus, ArtifactType, EmployeeRole, ExecutionStatus, CheckpointType, EventType, ModelProvider, MemoryType, KnowledgeEdgeType, QualityGateStatus) |

## Repository Health

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Tests** | ✅ Passing | 80/80 passing, 0 failures, 0 errors |
| **Build** | ⚠️ Not Configured | No CI pipeline wired yet; `make test` is a placeholder |
| **Packaging** | ✅ Working | `autoforge-models` installable via `pip install -e packages/models` |
| **Documentation** | ✅ Comprehensive | 22 architecture docs, ADR template, coding standards, data contracts |
| **Architecture** | ✅ Defined | Three-plane architecture (Control, Data, Persistence) with 15+ component specs |
| **Overall Health** | 🟢 Good | Foundation is solid; all tests pass; architecture is well-documented |

---

## Next Commit

**Objective:** Implement the Persistence Layer — repository interfaces and storage adapters for the canonical domain models.

This is the natural next step: the domain models are defined and tested, and the next subsystem that depends on them is the Persistence Plane. The commit should include:

- Abstract repository interfaces for each aggregate root
- In-memory repository implementations for testing
- Storage adapter base classes
- Unit tests for repository contracts

## Notes

This document must always reflect the latest state of the repository. Update it after every significant commit or phase completion. Metrics (test count, model count, debt items) should be verified against the current state of the codebase before each update.
