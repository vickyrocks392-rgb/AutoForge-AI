"""
AutoForge AI — Canonical Runtime Event Model.

This package defines the immutable, strongly-typed event model used
throughout the AutoForge AI platform. Events are data-only records
of something that happened in the system. They contain no behaviour,
no handlers, no subscribers, and no event bus integration.

The event model is designed to be transported by the Event Bus
(see ``docs/EVENT_BUS.md``) in a future integration layer.
